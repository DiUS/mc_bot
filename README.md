# mc_bot
Performs as the M.C. (Master of Ceremonies) at events announcing the order of the presentations, 

making IT related jokes, quoting Jobs and Gates and cueing the audience for applause.

It also has a timer countdown function and a gong that can be used to get people's attention. 

To use it - open the mc_bot.html file - and then disable the pop-up blocker for that page (there is a little icon 

at the left of the address bar on Chrome that shows if the pop-up blocker is working). 

The window that is spawned is the window that should be visible to the audience. 

The spawning window contains all of the controls for MCBot.
